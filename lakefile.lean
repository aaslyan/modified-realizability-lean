This project uses the Kleene–Kreisel continuous-functionals development
(`PureType`, `Assoc`, `Ct`, `CtPer`, `ctPer_iff_assoc`, `CtQ`).  The subset
it actually depends on — the transitive closure of
`ContinuousFunctionals.Hierarchy` and `ContinuousFunctionals.CtQ`, 12
files — is **vendored** into this repository under
`Realizability/Core/ContinuousFunctionals/`, copied verbatim from
`kleene-kreisel-lean`, and built as the in-tree library declared below.
There is no longer any dependency on a sibling `kleene-kreisel-lean`
checkout: this repository builds standalone.

Mathlib is pinned to the same version the vendored code was written
against (the continuous-functionals code reaches it through
`Sequences.lean`; the realizability engine reaches it through
`Epsilon0.lean`).
