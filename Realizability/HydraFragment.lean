# Phase H4: the Hydra game inside the fragment

`Hydra.lean` (Phases H1–H3) is pure metatheory: trees coded as naturals,
the Kirby–Paris move, an ordinal assignment, and the theorem that every
move strictly decreases it.  This module makes the fragment *speak* about
all of that — three new function symbols and four new axiom schemas — so
that Phase H5 can prove termination as a closed derivation, exactly the
way Phase D2 proved Goodstein's theorem.

## The symbols

| symbol | arity | evaluated by | reading |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hcut n c` | 2 | `hydraStepN` | one move on the hydra coded `c`, growing `n` copies at the grandparent |
| `hydra s t` | 2 | `hydraSeqN` | the state after `t` moves from the hydra coded `s` |
| `hord c` | 1 | `ordOfHydraN` | the ordinal notation assigned to the hydra coded `c` |

The fragment has one sort, `ℕ`, and the coding of H1 is a *bijection*
between `ℕ` and finite rooted trees — both round trips proved — so `∀h`
ranges over exactly the hydras, and no coding side condition is needed
anywhere.  The dead hydra is the bare head, whose code is `0`
(`hydraOf_eq_leaf_iff`), so `hydra(h, t) = 0` is literally "the battle
from `h` is over after `t` moves".  No new predicate, and no new
equality: termination is an equation of the fragment's own atomic
language.

## The schemas, and what is imported

* `hydraZero`, `hydraSucc` — the battle's recursion equations, in the
  style of `goodZero`/`goodSucc`.  Honest first-order schemas.
* `hcutNum` — the move's numeral graph, for the same reason `bump` and
  `prec` have one (a move is tree surgery through the decoding, which is
  course-of-values recursion, not a first-order equation schema).  It is
  what lets the fragment compute a concrete battle, below.
* `hordCutLt` — **the one imported mathematical fact of the phase**: a
  move on a live hydra strictly decreases its ordinal.  Its Lean twin is
  `olt_ordOfHydraN_step`, which is Phase H3's `cutH_descends` read on
  codes.

`hordCutLt` follows the `ordPredLt` pattern that Phase D5 established: it
is a property of *one* function symbol (`hcut`) relative to *one* ordinal
symbol (`hord`), and it says nothing whatever about the battle — no
sequence, no step counter, no stage-indexed replication.  It quantifies
over the number of regrown copies, so the fragment's proof works for
every replication rule at once, adversarial ones included.  Everything
Hydra-specific about the *battle* — gluing the descent to the recursion
equation, the case split on death, the induction — is the fragment's own
work in H5.

What is *not* claimed: that the fragment proves `hordCutLt` itself.  Like
Goodstein's three schemas it is an axiom of the object theory justified
by a Lean theorem, and internalizing it would mean formalizing tree
surgery and Cantor normal forms inside the fragment's equational
language.  The round trip `hydra_descent_via_fragment` below checks the
import is faithful — reading the schema back through `soundness` returns
exactly the H3 theorem — and STATUS.md records the gap.

/-! ## The battle, computed inside the fragment

The fragment does not merely *talk* about the battle: with the two
recursion equations and the move's numeral graph it derives the value of
every state of every concrete battle, by a derivation whose length is the
number of moves.  This is the Hydra analogue of `good_compute` in
`Goodstein.lean`. -/

/-- **The fragment computes the battle.**  For every start code and every
number of moves, the fragment derives the state's numeral — the same
number `hydraSeqN` computes. -/
def hydraComputeDeriv (start : ℕ) : (t : ℕ) →
    Deriv [] (Formula.eq (.hydra (numeral start) (numeral t))
      (numeral (hydraSeqN start t)))

  | t + 1 =>

        (Deriv.hcutNum (t + 1) (hydraSeqN start t))

/-- The worked battle of Phase H2, derived rather than computed: starting
from the two-deep chain (code `2`), the fragment proves the hydra is dead
after three moves.  The middle state is code `3` — two heads — so this
derivation passes through the step where the tree *grows*. -/

    Deriv [] (Formula.eq (.hydra (numeral 2) (numeral 3)) .zero) :=

ordinal, `2` the start hydra, `3` the move counter, `4` the existential

/-! ## Certification

The schemas are ordinary rules of the fragment, so soundness and generic
continuity apply to them with no new argument — that is the point of the
per-rule discipline.  The instances below are the ones H5 uses. -/

/-- And is continuous. -/

    Continuous2 (extract hydra_chain_derivable ρ [] 1) :=

/-- **The round trip**: reading the imported schema back through
`soundness` recovers exactly Phase H3's descent theorem, at every
replication factor and every live hydra.

This is what makes the import faithful rather than merely consistent: the
fragment's `hordCutLt`, passed through the realizability interpretation,
*is* `cutH_descends` on codes — not a weaker or differently-quantified
statement. -/
