# Phase H9: a second strategy, for free

Phase H7 proved that *every* play terminates, whatever Hercules chops.
This module cashes that in: it defines a genuinely different strategy —
chop the **rightmost** head instead of the leftmost — and gets its descent
theorem with no induction re-run, purely by exhibiting its moves as
instances of H7's `Play` relation.

That is the test of whether H7 bought anything.  A general theorem that
cannot be applied to a second instance without redoing the work is not
general.

## What is here

* `cutRightF`/`rightStep` — the rightmost-head move, same grandparent
  regrowth, same replication parameter.
* `rightStep_play` — every rightmost move is a legal `Play`.
* **`rightStep_descends`** — hence the ordinal drops, *by one line*:
  `play_descends (rightStep_play …)`.  Compare H3's `cutH_descends`,
  which is a three-case induction over the tree consuming three separate
  ordinal lemmas.  None of that is repeated here; it was absorbed into H7.
* `no_infinite_right_battle` — and termination, likewise, from
  `no_infinite_play`.

## The strategies really are different, and the lengths really do agree

`#guard`ed at every build: the rightmost strategy gives the same published
lengths `1, 3, 37` on the path hydras, while `strategies_differ` shows the
two battles pass through *different* states — after three moves the
leftmost strategy is at `(o o o o (o) (o))` and the rightmost at
`((o) (o) o o o o)`.

The path hydras are the right test precisely because they *start* as
chains, where the two strategies agree; they diverge as soon as the first
regrowth branches the tree, and still land on the same length.

**Stated carefully**: that the battle length is independent of the
strategy is a known result which is **not proved here**.  What is proved
here is that both strategies terminate (via H7); what is *checked* is that
their lengths agree at the three published instances.  STATUS.md
previously reported that agreement on the authority of a research pass —
the build now checks it.

/-! ## The rightmost-head move

Defined on forests rather than hydras, walking to the *last* member
instead of the first.  The `Bool` means what it means in `cutH` — "the
head I chopped was a direct member of this forest" — so the owner of the
forest learns whether it is the grandparent and must grow the copies. -/
