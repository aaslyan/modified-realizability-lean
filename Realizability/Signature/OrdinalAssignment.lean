# The value-level layer between the notations and the fragment

Everything the fragment's function symbols evaluate by, that is not pure
arithmetic: the fueled base-`k` logarithm, hereditary base change
(`bumpN`), the Goodstein sequence (`goodN`), and — new in Phase D1 — the
**ordinal assignment** `ordOf`, which sends a Goodstein state `(k, n)` to
the code of the ordinal of `n`'s hereditary base-`k` representation read
at base `ω`.

## Why this module exists where it does

`hlog`/`bumpN`/`goodN` were introduced in Phase B at the head of
`Syntax.lean`, because `Term.eval` consumes them.  Phase D adds the
function symbol `ord`, evaluated by `ordOf`, and — this is the part that
forces a module of its own — `Soundness.lean` needs the *theorems* of
Phase D1 to discharge the `ordDescent` case.  So the definitions and
their theory both have to precede `Syntax.lean`.  The functions and their
Phase-B facts were moved here unchanged; `Goodstein.lean` and
`TransfiniteInduction.lean` keep everything else.

## What Phase D1 proves here (the three obligations Phase C named)

1. `nfB_ordOf` — the assignment lands in **normal form**, so Phase C's
   order applies to it.  This is Phase B's deferred canonicity, in code
   form: it needs the digit bounds and the exponent ordering, hence real
   logarithm theory (`lt_pow_hlog_succ` and friends), which Phase B did
   not build.
2. `ordOf_bumpN` — **bumping the base does not change the ordinal**, in
   general, not just at the instances Phase C kernel-checked.  Needs the
   fuel-adequacy lemma `ordOfAux_eq_of_le` first, as Phase C predicted,
   because the two sides recurse at different fuels.
3. `ordOf_descent` — **one Goodstein step strictly decreases the
   ordinal**.  Given 2, this is monotonicity of the assignment
   (`olt_ordOf_of_lt`) applied to `bumpN k n - 1 < bumpN k n`.

A correction to Phase C's own prediction, recorded in STATUS.md: it
guessed that (3) would be the obligation using `tiEps0`'s machinery.  It
does not — all three are value-level arithmetic, and `tiEps0` enters only
in `GoodsteinTheorem.lean`, where the *induction* is performed.  What (3)
does need is (2) plus monotonicity, and monotonicity is the same
digit-comparison work as (1), so (1) and (3) share their hard core.

/-! ## The value-level Goodstein functions (Phase B)

The semantics of the Phase-B function symbols `bump` and `good`, as
plain `ℕ`-functions defined *before* `Term` so `Term.eval` can consume
them.  All recursions are **fuel-structural** (fuel `= n` is adequate,
`Goodstein.lean` proves it) rather than well-founded: `WellFounded.fix`
does not reduce in the kernel, and the certifying derivations of
`Goodstein.lean` need concrete Goodstein values to compute by
`rfl`/`decide`.  For the same reason the base-`b` logarithm is a local
fueled definition rather than Mathlib's well-founded `Nat.log`. -/

/-- The base-`b` logarithm, self-fueled: `hlog b n` is the largest `e`
with `b ^ e ≤ n` (for `1 < b ≤ n`; zero in the degenerate cases) —
`Goodstein.lean` proves the two facts used (`hlog_lt`,
`pow_hlog_le`). -/
def hlog (b n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  hlogAux b n n

/-- **Hereditary base change, value level** (fueled): `bumpNAux k fuel n`
peels the leading base-`k` digit `n = k^e·c + r` (`e = hlog k n`,
`c = n / k^e`, `r = n % k^e`) and rewrites it at base `k + 1` with the
exponent *itself* hereditarily rewritten:
`(k+1)^(bump e)·c + bump r`.  Corresponds to
`WilliamAngus/Goodstein`'s `(HBase.f k · (k+1)).eval ∘ HBase.ofNat k`
(the structural base-replacement `f` on the `ofNat` representation);
checked concretely: `bumpN 2 4 = 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 ^ 0 = 27`, both here and
there (`4 = 2^2^2^0`).  Degenerate bases are the identity
(`bumpN 0 n = bumpN 1 n = n`), so no `2 ≤ k` side condition is ever
needed for soundness. -/

`start = 2`: their step `i → i + 1` applies the base-change `G` at base
`start + i = 2 + i`, exactly this `bumpN (s + 2)` at `i = s` (indexing
convention checked against their `g`/`G`; values checked:

/-! ## The fueled logarithm: the two facts used

`hlog` (`Syntax.lean`) is structural in its fuel so the kernel can
compute it; fuel `= n` is adequate.  Only two facts about it are ever
needed: the leading exponent is *small* (`hlog_lt`, which powers every
fuel-adequacy argument below) and *correct enough* (`pow_hlog_le`,
which bounds the digit remainder).  No further logarithm theory is
built. -/

/-! ## Logarithm theory (Phase D1)

Phase B needed exactly two facts about `hlog` (`hlog_lt`, `pow_hlog_le`).
The digit bounds and the exponent ordering — the canonicity content Phase
B deferred — need the *maximality* half as well, so the theory is built
here.  Everything below assumes `2 ≤ k`; the degenerate bases are never
used by the Goodstein sequence (its bases are `s + 2`), and `hlog` is
identically `0` there anyway. -/

`bumpN` was only ever *computed* in Phase B (its correctness there is the

needs it as a *function*: that it is strictly monotone, and that it
respects the digit bound — `r < k^e` implies `bump r < (k+1)^(bump e)`.
The two are proved together, by one strong induction, because each step
of either needs the other at smaller arguments. -/
