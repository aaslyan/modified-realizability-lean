# Phase E1: the Tower of Hanoi, at the value level

The third independence-flavoured showpiece of this development — except
that Hanoi is *not* independent of anything.  It is an ordinary
PA-provable statement, and that is exactly why it is here: it exercises
the pipeline on a theorem needing **no `TI(ε₀)` at all**, only ordinary
induction and the arithmetic of Phase A, and it has a genuinely
*branching* recursion (two sub-calls per level) where Goodstein and Hydra
both had linear chains.

This module is the value layer, and like `Hydra.lean` it sits **before
`Syntax.lean`**: `Term.eval` evaluates the Phase-E2 symbols by the
functions defined here, so every definition below must stay
`Classical`-free and kernel-computable.  Proofs are unconstrained.

## The encodings, both reused rather than rebuilt

A **move** is a pair of pegs, encoded arithmetically: `mvN src dst =
src * 3 + dst`.  Nothing new is needed for it — the fragment already has
`×` and `+`, so the fragment can *write* a move.

A **move sequence** is a list, encoded with the cons coding
`Hydra.lean` already uses for forests, over the triangular pairing of
`Epsilon0.lean`:

    ⌜nil⌝ = 0        ⌜cons m k⌝ = ⟪m, k⟫ + 1

That is the third client of that one pairing and the second client of
this list convention; no second scheme is introduced.

## The solver, in difference-list form

`hanoiAux n from to via rest` prepends the `n`-disk solution to `rest`:

    hanoiAux 0       f t v r = r
    hanoiAux (n + 1) f t v r = hanoiAux n f v t (cons (f,t) (hanoiAux n v t f r))

Writing it this way — an accumulator rather than an append — is what
keeps this module free of general list theory: the correctness proof
never needs associativity, only the two `hanoiAux` equations.  `happN`
(genuine concatenation) is defined anyway, because the *fragment's*
induction step has to build its witness from two sub-witnesses it
receives as opaque values, and `hanoiN_succ` connects the two forms.

## `Solves` as a parser

`hcheck n f t v k` reads an `n`-disk solution off the front of `k` and
returns the rest, or `none`.  `solvesN n f t v k = 1` exactly when the
whole of `k` is such a solution.  This is a genuine *validator* — it
checks the shape of an arbitrary `k` — not "`k` equals the canonical
answer", which is what makes the existence theorem say something.

/-! ## Uniqueness — what "optimal" does and does not mean here

`solvesN` accepts exactly one sequence, and it is the canonical solution.
That is worth proving rather than assuming, because it is what turns the
existence theorem's "`MoveCount k = 2^n − 1`" into a statement about
*every* solution the relation admits, not just the one the derivation
happens to produce.

What it does **not** give is classical minimality — "no legal sequence of
moves solves the puzzle in fewer steps".  That would need a different
`Solves`: a legality relation on arbitrary sequences, with a tower-state
semantics (a disk may only move onto a larger one), of which the
recursive shape here is one particular family.  The classical `2^n − 1`
lower bound over *that* relation is not formalized and is not claimed;
see STATUS.md's Phase-E section. -/

solution scores `0`.  Without this the existence theorem would be
vacuous — `solves` could have been the constant `1`. -/
