# Phase F1: Pascal's triangle mod 2, at the value level

The simplest of the development's showpieces, and deliberately so: the
statement is a **decidable equation**, not an existence statement, so the
extract is a genuine decision *function* rather than a witness — and what
it decides, drawn as a triangle, is the Sierpiński gasket.  No `TI(ε₀)`,
no ordinals, and (unlike Hanoi) no `∃` either: ordinary induction and the
arithmetic of Phase A suffice.

This module is the value layer and sits **before `Syntax.lean`**, so every
definition here must stay `Classical`-free and kernel-computable.

## The recursion

    pas(0, 0)         = 1
    pas(0, k + 1)     = 0
    pas(n + 1, 0)     = 1
    pas(n + 1, k + 1) = pas(n, k) XOR pas(n, k + 1)

Structural in the first argument, with both recursive calls at `n` — a
branching recursion like Hanoi's, though a cheap one.  The two clauses
the brief lists as characteristic, `pas(n,n) = 1` and (implicitly)
`pas(n,k) = 0` above the diagonal, are **not** axioms: they are derived
inside the fragment in Phase F3.

## Why `XOR` is a symbol and not a term

The brief offers `a + b − 2·a·b` or a case-split axiom.  Neither is used,
for a reason worth recording: **`a + b − 2ab` is not expressible in this
fragment at all.**  The signature's arithmetic is `+`, `×`, `exp` and
`pred`, and `pred` is the only non-monotone operation — it can subtract a
*constant* from a term (`x − 1`, `x − 2`, …) but there is no term for
`1 − x`, since a composition of monotone operations under finitely many
outer `pred`s is monotone in `x` and `1 − x` is not.

So `xor` enters as its own symbol, by its **numeral graph** — the
`bumpNum`/`precNum`/`hcutNum` pattern this development already uses three
times, and for the same reason each time: the function is decidable and
the fragment computes it on numerals, but its definition (here, parity of
a sum) is not a first-order equation schema over the fragment's terms.
The case analysis then happens where it belongs, in the *proofs*, driven
by the totality theorem rather than by four conditional axioms.
