# Phase H1: finite rooted trees as natural numbers

The Kirby–Paris Hydra game needs the fragment to quantify over *trees*,
and the fragment has one sort: `ℕ`.  So hydras are coded as naturals,
the same way Phase C coded ordinal notations — and, as there, the coding
is built from scratch rather than taken from Mathlib.

## Why from scratch again

Phase C's experience is the reason, and it is worth restating because it
is the constraint that shapes this file.  Mathlib's `Nat.pair`/
`Nat.unpair` were unusable there for two independent reasons: *every*
lemma about them depends on `Classical.choice` (measured, not assumed),
which would propagate into `extract` and break the continuity theorems'
`[propext, Quot.sound]` budget; and `Nat.unpair` goes through `Nat.sqrt`,
which does not reduce in the kernel, which would cost every `rfl`
cross-check.  `Epsilon0.lean` therefore has a hand-rolled triangular
pairing that is choice-free and kernel-computable, with `pr`/`pr1`/`pr2`
and the bijection lemmas.  **This file reuses that pairing**; it adds no
new coding primitive, only the list-of-children layer on top.

## The trees, and the coding

A hydra is a finite rooted tree: a node together with a finite, possibly
empty, list of child hydras.  Written as a mutual pair of inductives —
`Hydra` and `Forest` — rather than as `Hydra := List Hydra`, because
mutual structural recursion over the pair is what the encode/decode
proofs need, and nested inductives make those proofs fight the recursor.

Codes follow the standard list coding through the pairing:

    ⌜nil⌝            = 0
    ⌜cons h f⌝       = ⟪⌜h⌝, ⌜f⌝⟫ + 1
    ⌜node f⌝         = ⌜f⌝

A hydra's code *is* its forest's code, since a node carries no data
beyond its children.  Because `pr` is a bijection and the `+1` separates
the empty forest from the nonempty ones, the coding is a bijection
between `ℕ` and hydras — both round trips are proved below
(`decode_encode`, `encode_decode`), which is what makes "the fragment's
`∀x` ranges over exactly the hydras" true rather than approximate.

Decoding is fueled, like every other recursion in this development: the
components `pr1 n` and `pr2 n` are `≤ n` (`pr1_le`, `pr2_le`), so fuel
`= n` is adequate (`decodeF_eq_of_le`).

/-! ## Phase H2: the cutting-and-regrowth step

The rule implemented here (see STATUS.md for the citation and for the
variants that exist in the literature):

* a **head** is a leaf — a node with no children;
* Hercules chops one head off.  Let `p` be the head's parent;
* if `p` is the **root**, the head is simply removed and nothing grows;
* otherwise let `g` be `p`'s parent.  After the head is removed from `p`,
  the hydra grows `n` extra copies of the resulting subtree at `p`, all
  attached to `g`.  The modified `p` itself stays where it was.

Two parameters are left open and fixed by the caller, deliberately:
**which** head is chopped (here: the leftmost, per H4's canonical-strategy
decision) and **how many** copies grow (`n`, so the theorems quantify over
it and cover both the "n at stage n" and the adversarial readings).

`cutH` returns the new subtree together with a flag saying "the head I
chopped was a *direct child* of me", which is exactly the information the
caller needs to decide whether it is the grandparent and must therefore
grow the copies.  At the root the flag is discarded — which is precisely
the "parent is the root, nothing grows" clause. -/

/-- **One Hydra move**: chop the leftmost head, growing `n` copies at the

child of this node, i.e. whether *this node's parent* is the grandparent
that must grow the copies. -/

      let child : Hydra := .node (.cons c₀ cs)

root with one child carrying one head; chopping that head empties the
child, and the root — the grandparent — grows a copy of it, leaving code

the phenomenon in miniature, and the reason the assigned ordinal, not the
node count, is what decreases (Phase H3). -/
theorem hydraSeq_one : (hydraSeqN 1 0, hydraSeqN 1 1) = (1, 0) := rfl

/-! ### Path hydras and the published battle lengths

The discriminating cross-check.  A *path hydra* is a chain: `path k` has
`k + 1` nodes.  Under Kirby–Paris the battle lengths are `1, 3, 37, …`
(the fourth exceeds Graham's number); under the *other* game in
circulation — copies as bare leaves attached to the parent — they are
`1, 3, 11, …`.  Getting `37` therefore pins down both the grandparent
rule and the copy count.

`battleLen` counts moves to death with the stage-indexed replication this
file uses.  Paths 1 and 2 are checked by `rfl` at build time; path 3 takes
about ninety seconds, so it is verified out of band and recorded in
STATUS.md rather than run on every build:

    #eval battleLen 200 1 (encodeH (path 3))   -- 37

    (battleLen 20 1 (encodeH (path 1)), battleLen 20 1 (encodeH (path 2)))
      = (1, 3) := rfl

/-! ## Phase H3 (in progress): the ordinal assignment

The measure that decreases even when the tree grows.  A hydra is sent to
a Cantor-normal-form notation of `Epsilon0.lean` — **no second ordinal
encoding**, the same principle Phase C's `ordTerm` followed:

    ord(node [c₁, …, cₖ])  =  ω^(ord c₁) ⊕ … ⊕ ω^(ord cₖ)

the natural (Hessenberg) sum, built by inserting one exponent at a time
into a normal form.  Insertion is where the ordinal arithmetic this
development did not previously have lives: given an exponent `e` and a
normal form `c`, produce the normal form of `ω^e ⊕ c` by comparing `e`
against `c`'s head exponent — equal exponents merge into the
coefficient, a larger one is prepended, a smaller one recurses into the
remainder.

`ordOfForest` is then a plain structural recursion over the tree, needing
no fuel; only `insertExp` is fueled, on `oR c < c`. -/

/-- **Inserting strictly increases the ordinal**: `c ≺ ω^e ⊕ c`.

At `e = 0` this *is* the base case of the descent, read backwards:
`ord(node (leaf :: rest)) = ω^0 ⊕ ord(rest) ≻ ord(rest)`, i.e. chopping a
head whose parent is the root strictly lowers the ordinal.  The cases
follow the three order constructors — bigger coefficient, bigger head
exponent, bigger remainder — with the last recursing. -/

`NOTES_insertExp_monotonicity.md` for the grid this follows: row `Z`
(`c₁ = 0`) settles with one constructor each; the equal-head rows collapse
to the diagonal, because both accumulators compare `e` against the same
head and so take the same branch, and only the both-recursed corner uses
the induction hypothesis; the smaller-head rows need transitivity to place
`c₁` from `c₂`'s branch condition. -/

/-- **Monotonicity of insertion in the exponent**: inserting a smaller
exponent into the same normal form gives a smaller normal form.

Grid, per the notes: `b`'s branch drives the case analysis.  If `b` merges
(`b = oE X`) then `a ≺ oE X`, so `a` recurses, and the two sides differ by
one in the coefficient.  If `b` prepends then all three of `a`'s branches
give a head strictly below `b`, so each is one exponent comparison.  If
`b` recurses then `a ≺ b ≺ oE X` forces `a` to recurse too, and the
induction hypothesis finishes it. -/

`insertIter e n X` is the `n`-fold insertion of `ω^e` into `X` — the
ordinal of a node that grew `n` copies.  The bound below is what makes
arbitrarily many copies harmless, and note where `n` appears in its
proof: only as a coefficient, in the two places the order constructors
ignore coefficients.  The induction is on `X`, with `n` general. -/
