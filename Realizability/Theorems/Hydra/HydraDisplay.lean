# Phase H8: running the battle, and seeing it

Two things this module adds, both of which the earlier phases wanted and
neither of which needed new mathematics.

## 1. The battle, a hundred times faster — and certified to be the same one

`battleLen` (Phase H2) runs the battle **on codes**: every move decodes a
natural number into a tree, cuts, and re-encodes.  That is what made the
discriminating cross-check `Hydra(3) = 37` take ≈ 98 s and forced it out
of the build.

The cost was never the pairing — Phase H2 already made `tri` constant-time
and `unTri` logarithmic.  It is that hydra codes grow *doubly*
exponentially: `⟪a,b⟫ ≈ (a+b)²/2`, so nesting depth `d` squares the
magnitude `d` times, and the path-3 battle reaches 20-node trees.  Every
step was doing arithmetic on numbers with astronomically many digits, to
compute something the tree itself answers instantly.

`battleLenH` runs the same battle directly on `Hydra`, never encoding.
Same 37, in under a second — and `battleLen_eq_battleLenH` **proves the
two agree at every fuel, stage and code**, so the fast version is not a
different measurement, it is the same one without the arithmetic.

The three published Kirby–Paris lengths are therefore `#guard`ed at every
build now, `37` included.  That number is the discriminating one: the
*other* game in circulation (copies as bare leaves at the parent) gives
`1, 3, 11`, so landing on `37` pins down both the grandparent rule and the
copy count.  It used to be a claim in STATUS.md checked by hand; it is now
checked by the build.

## 2. The trace: the tree grows, the ordinal falls

`battleTrace` prints each state in bracket notation with its ordinal
beside it.  On the 4-node path the first steps read

    (((o)))            [ω^ω]
    ((o o))            [ω^2]
    ((o) (o) (o))      [ω·3]
    (o o o o (o) (o))  [ω·2 + 4]

— the hydra gaining nodes at every step while the measure comes down.
`sizeTrace` is the same battle as node counts: `4, 4, 7, 9, 8, …, 20, 19,
…, 1`, peaking at five times its starting size before it dies.

`descendsAlong` checks the descent step by step along the real battle, and
is `#guard`ed too.  That is a *demonstration*, not a proof — the proof is
`cutH_descends` (H3), which covers every hydra and every replication
factor, and `hercules_wins` (H7), which covers every play.  What the
`#guard` adds is that the thing proved and the thing computed are visibly
the same thing.

/-! ### The published values, now checked at every build

`Hydra(k)` for the path hydra with `k + 1` nodes.  `37` is the
discriminating value: the other game in circulation gives `11` here. -/

#guard battleLenH 20 1 (path 1) == 1
#guard battleLenH 20 1 (path 2) == 3
#guard battleLenH 200 1 (path 3) == 37

/-- The same three, stated as a theorem about the *code-level* function —
which is the one Phase H2's `battleLen_small` and the citation discussion
are about.  Paths 1 and 2 reduce in the kernel; path 3 is left to the
`#guard` above, since kernel reduction does not use the compiled
closed forms for `tri`/`unTri`. -/

    (battleLen 20 1 (encodeH (path 1)), battleLen 20 1 (encodeH (path 2)))

/-! ## The descent, watched rather than proved -/

/-- Does the ordinal strictly drop at every step of the real battle? -/
def descendsAlong : ℕ → ℕ → Hydra → Bool

        precB (ordOfHydra h') (ordOfHydra h) && descendsAlong f (stage + 1) h'

/-! Checked at every build: along the whole 37-move battle on the 4-node
path, every single move lowered the ordinal — while the tree grew from 4
nodes to 20.  (The *theorem* is `cutH_descends`; this is the picture of
it.) -/

/-! ## The pictures

The 3-node path in full: four states, `ω ≻ 2 ≻ 1 ≻ 0`, with the middle
step the one where the tree gets *wider* (one child with one head becomes
two heads). -/

#eval battleTrace 100 1 (path 2)

/-! The 4-node path, first ten of its thirty-eight states.  Read the two
columns against each other: the bracket string gets longer, the ordinal
gets smaller, at every line. -/

#eval (battleTrace 200 1 (path 3)).take 10

/-! And the whole 37-move battle as node counts.  It peaks at 20 — five
times the starting size — and the ordinal came down at all 37 steps
(`descendsAlong`, above). -/
