# Phase D5: the Goodstein descent, derived instead of imported

Phase D2 gave the fragment its Goodstein proof but imported one composite
fact as an axiom schema: *bump the base, subtract one, and the ordinal
strictly decreases*.  That fact is the mathematical heart of Goodstein's
theorem, so importing it was the honest weak point of the D2 result — the
fragment proved the theorem *relative to* the very step that makes it
true.

This module removes that import.  The fragment now derives the descent
(`Deriv.ordDescent`, same statement and same name as the former
constructor, so `GoodsteinTheorem.lean` is unchanged) from three
*separate* properties, each of which is a property of a single symbol
rather than of a Goodstein step:

| schema | says | Phase-D1 theorem discharging it |
|---|---|---|
| `ordBump` | base change leaves the ordinal alone | `ordOf_bumpN` |
| `ordPredLt` | the assignment is strictly monotone at `pred` | `olt_ordOf_of_lt` |
| `bumpNeZero` | bumping a nonzero number gives a nonzero number | `bumpN_ne_zero` |

## What this does and does not achieve

**Does**: the composite — D1's obligation 3, `ordOf_descent` — is no
longer assumed anywhere.  The fragment reproves it syntactically, and
`ordOf_descent` is now unused by the pipeline (it survives in
`OrdinalAssignment.lean` as the semantic twin of what is derived here).
No imported schema is about the Goodstein sequence, or about a *step* of
anything; each is one property of one function symbol.

**Does not**: eliminate the fragment's dependence on metatheory.  The
three schemas are still axioms of the fragment, justified by theorems
proved in Lean rather than derivations inside the object theory.  Fully
internalizing them would require the fragment to *state and prove*
elementary number theory about the hereditary representation — it would
need `hlog`, `div` and `mod` as symbols with their recursion equations, an
order relation (the fragment has only equations), course-of-values
induction derived from `ind`, and then the whole of Phase D1 redone
syntactically.  That is a research-scale project, not a phase; STATUS.md
records what it would take.

So the gap is narrowed from "the theorem's core lemma is assumed" to
"three general properties of the ordinal assignment are assumed", and the
Goodstein-specific reasoning is now entirely the fragment's own.

the fragment can derive the corresponding instance from the numeral graph

/-- **The Goodstein descent, derived inside the fragment.**

From `n ≠ 0`: bumping gives a nonzero number (`bumpNeZero`), so taking
its predecessor strictly decreases the ordinal at the bumped base
(`ordPredLt`), and the bumped base's ordinal is the original one
(`ordBump`) — rewriting the right-hand side with that equation, by
congruence of `prec`, is what turns the two facts into the descent.

Same statement and same name as the axiom schema D2 used, so every use
site — in particular `GoodsteinTheorem.lean`'s `descentDeriv` and hence
`goodsteinTheorem` itself — is untouched by the change. -/

/-! ## Certification

The derived descent is a closed derivation-former like any other, so
soundness and generic continuity apply to it with no new argument.  The
instance below is the one `goodsteinTheorem` actually uses (base `s`,
value `good m s`), at the empty context. -/

/-- The derived descent realizes what it says. -/

      (Formula.eq

            (.pred (.bump (.succ (.succ b)) n)))
          (.ord (.succ (.succ b)) n))
        (.succ .zero))) m
      (extract (Deriv.ordDescent (Γ := []) b n) ρ [] m) :=
  soundness (Deriv.ordDescent (Γ := []) b n) ρ [] trivial m hm

/-- And its type-2 extract is continuous. -/

/-- **The round trip, and the point of the phase**: reading the fragment's
*derived* descent back through soundness recovers the semantic descent —
D1's obligation 3 — at every base `≥ 2` and every nonzero value.

This is what makes the derivation non-vacuous.  `ordOf_descent` is proved
independently in `OrdinalAssignment.lean`, but it is no longer *assumed*
by the fragment: the statement below is obtained from
`Deriv.ordDescent`'s derivation via `soundness`, using only the three
component schemas.  Fragment-side derivation and metatheoretic theorem now
agree, and neither is defined in terms of the other. -/
