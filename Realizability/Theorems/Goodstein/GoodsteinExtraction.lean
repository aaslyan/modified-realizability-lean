# Phase D3: the extracted function

What the roadmap was for.  `goodsteinTheorem` (Phase D2) is a closed
derivation of `∀m ∃t. good(m,t) = 0`; modified realizability turns it
into a *program*, because the realizer of an existential **carries its
witness**.  This module reads that witness off and certifies it three
ways:

* `goodsteinStopTime_spec` — the extracted number really is a stopping
  time: `goodN m (goodsteinStopTime m) = 0`, for **every** `m`.  Proved
  from `soundness`, not by computation, so it holds at values no
  evaluator will ever reach;
* `goodstein_extract_continuous` — the extract is `Continuous2`, by the
  generic continuity theorem, with no modification and no per-derivation
  certificate;
* `goodsteinRealizesCtQ` — hence it has a class in `CtQ 2`, the
  extensional collapse of the Kleene–Kreisel development.

And it runs: see the `#eval`s at the end, and the timings recorded in
STATUS.md.

/-- **The extracted stopping-time function.**  Apply the realizer to the
start value and read the witness component of the existential — the
first component at the canonical point, which is exactly where `exIC`
puts it.  Ambient 12 is the derivation's own bound, so this is the
realizer *at the level where it is certified*. -/

/-- **The extracted function is correct**, at every start value: the
Goodstein sequence from `m` is `0` after `goodsteinStopTime m` steps.
This is soundness instantiated at the theorem — the realizer's witness
clause *is* this statement — so it needs no computation and holds far
beyond where evaluation could reach. -/

/-! ## Running it

The extraction pipeline is executable (`extract` and the transports
compile), so the realizer can simply be run.  `goodsteinStopTime m` is
the extracted witness; the classical values are

    m       0  1  2  3
    stop    0  1  3  5

(`G(3) = 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0` reaches `0` at step 5, matching Phase B's
`goodN_three`).  Timings are recorded in STATUS.md; `m = 4` is not
attempted — its sequence is astronomically long (`goodN 4 3 = 60` and
growing), and the realizer would have to run every step.

The `#eval`s below are the fast ones, so the build stays quick; the
larger ones are in READERS_GUIDE.md as commands to run. -/

/-- The value-level sequence agrees with the extracted witness at `m = 1`
(kernel-checked, independent of the evaluator). -/
