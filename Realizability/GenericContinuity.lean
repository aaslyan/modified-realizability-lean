# Generic continuity: every extracted realizer is continuous

The theorem closing the gap flagged in STATUS.md: for **every** closed
derivation `D : Deriv [] φ`, the extracted type-2 realizer
`extract D ρ [] 1` is continuous (`Continuous2`), so `RealizesCtQ`
applies uniformly — no per-derivation certificate.

## The invariant

The compositional invariant is *not* "the extract has an associate at
every ambient" (that is the parent project's deferred countability
chapter, whose hard core is associate-level abstraction closure).  It is
the **oracle-parameterized continuity relation**, a logical relation on
families indexed by a Baire-space oracle `α`:

* a family `X : (ℕ → ℕ) → PureType 0` is *tracked* iff it is
  `Continuous2`;
* a family `X : (ℕ → ℕ) → PureType (n + 1)` is *tracked* iff its
  pointwise application to every tracked family of arguments is a
  continuous function of the oracle.

Tracking says nothing about any single functional `X α` in isolation —
it constrains only the ways a number can be read out of the family
through continuously supplied arguments.  That is exactly what the
capstone needs (`extract D ρ [] 1` applied to the tracked identity
family `α ↦ α` *is* the extract as a functional of `α`), and it is
closed under abstraction *by β-reduction*: `abs₁ G` applied to a tracked
argument family literally computes `G` at tracked components, so the
`impIC`/`allIC` cases cost nothing beyond the closure lemmas for the
pairing devices.  This is the classical relative-continuity argument
(the Kripke logical relation over the oracle) — it sidesteps associate
construction entirely, which is why the level-≤1 restriction of the
brief is not even needed: continuity of the extract holds for every
closed derivation, at every ambient the capstone consults.

## Contents

* `Continuous2` closure lemmas (constants, composition, diagonal
  evaluation, pointwise case split);
* `Tracked`, with closure under every pure-type device of
  `ModifiedRealizes.lean` (`up`/`down`, `pairPT`/`fstPT`/`sndPT`,
  `app₁`/`abs₁`, `natPT`, `defaultPT`);
* tracking preservation for the transports of `Transport.lean`
  (`liftR`/`dropR` by the same mutual formula induction as
  `MR_liftR_dropR`, then `liftIter`/`dropIter`/`famOf`);
* **one named preservation lemma per extraction combinator** (the same
  per-rule discipline as `Extraction.lean` — one lemma per rule, listed
  in STATUS.md);
* `extract_tracked` — the induction on `Deriv` threading the invariant;
* **`extract_continuous`** — the capstone.

oracle.  A Kripke-style logical relation over the oracle — the

/-- **Generic continuity of extraction** (the theorem closing the gap
flagged in STATUS.md): the extracted type-2 realizer of *every* closed
derivation is continuous.  The brief's level restriction `lvl φ ≤ 1` is
not needed: continuity of the extract is a property of the extraction
combinators alone, independent of what the extract realizes (the level
enters only through `soundness`, when the realizer is asked to realize
`φ` at ambient 1).

Instantiate the invariant at the constant environment and empty
context, then read the extract off along the tracked identity family:
the extract applied to the oracle *is* the extract as a functional. -/
