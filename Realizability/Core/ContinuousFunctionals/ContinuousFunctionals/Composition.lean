# Composition: an explicit associate for `α ↦ F (G α)`

Stretch goal.  Given

* an associate `a` for `F : (ℕ → ℕ) → ℕ`, and
* for each output coordinate `k`, an associate `g k` for the component
  functional `α ↦ G α k` of a map `G : (ℕ → ℕ) → (ℕ → ℕ)`,

this file *constructs* — not merely proves to exist — an associate
`compAssociate a g` for the composite `α ↦ F (G α)`
(`isAssociate_compAssociate`).  This is the type-2 kernel of the fact that
the countable functionals compose: Kleene's application `f | g` of
associates (Longley, *Notions of computability at higher types I*, §3.3.1;
Longley–Normann 2015, Ch. 8) computed with finite lookahead.

The construction, on (the code of) a finite sequence `σ`:

1. run each coordinate associate `g k` along the prefix chain of `σ`
   (`coordVal`); by the first-fire principle, whenever `σ` is a genuine
   initial segment of some `α`, a nonzero answer is the *correct* value
   `G α k + 1` — tentative values are never wrong, only absent;
2. collect the longest determined initial segment of the output
   (`readyLen`, `tentativeOut`), capping its length by `σ.length` so the
   search is bounded;
3. run `a` along the prefix chain of that determined output segment
   (`chainVal`).

Every search is bounded, so `compAssociate` is a computable function of
`a` and `g` — no classical choice enters the definition, only the proofs.

The corollary `continuous2_comp` restates the theorem for continuity alone:
if `F` is continuous and each `α ↦ G α k` is continuous, so is
`α ↦ F (G α)`.  (The brief types the second map as `G : ℕ → (ℕ → ℕ)`,
whose composite with `F` would be a type-1 function with no continuity
content; the intended reading formalized here is `G : (ℕ → ℕ) → (ℕ → ℕ)`,
continuous componentwise.  See STATUS.md.)

/-- **Composition theorem** (stretch goal).  If `a` is an associate for
`F` and, for each output coordinate `k`, `g k` is an associate for
`α ↦ G α k`, then `compAssociate a g` — explicitly constructed above — is
an associate for the composite `α ↦ F (G α)`.

Existence of a firing stage: take a stage past the firing stages (on `α`)
of the first `p` coordinate associates and past `p` itself, where `p` is
the outer associate's witness stage on `G α`; then the reconstructed
output segment extends `initSeg (G α) p` and the outer chain fires.
Correctness at the *least* firing stage is automatic: the reconstructed
segment is always a genuine initial segment of `G α`
(`tentativeOut_initSeg`), so a nonzero outer chain value is forced to be
`F (G α) + 1` by the first-fire principle — no monotonicity analysis of
`readyLen` in the stage is needed.  All of this happens in the level-free
