# Phase A: `+` and `×`, their defining equations as `ind` theorems

The four briefed equations

* `∀x. x + 0 = x`
* `∀x ∀y. x + succ y = succ (x + y)`
* `∀x. x × 0 = 0`
* `∀x ∀y. x × succ y = (x × y) + x`

proved as closed derivations of the fragment — **every one of them by
the induction rule `ind`**, not cited as axioms.

## The design (Option 2 of the brief, "mirror recursion" form)

The axioms *defining* `+`/`×` (`Syntax.lean`) recurse on the **first**
argument: `0 + t = t`, `succ s + t = succ (s + t)`, `0 × t = 0`,
`succ s × t = (s × t) + t`.  The briefed equations recurse on the
*second* argument, so each is a genuine theorem, proved by `ind` on its
first argument — the exact mirror of how Lean's own `Nat.add` (which
recurses on the second argument) makes `0 + n = n` a theorem by
induction.  Had the defining axioms been the briefed equations
themselves, all four deliverables would have been one `allI` away from
an axiom and `ind` would never fire — Option 2 would have collapsed
into Option 1 with different labels.  See STATUS.md.

The multiplication step case needs one auxiliary induction,
`plusRightCommDeriv` (`(z + x) + y = (z + y) + x`), itself an `ind`
theorem — five inductions in total.

## Bound variables and capture

`∀`-elimination's `SubstOK` side condition forbids instantiating
`∀x∀y. φ` at a term containing `y`.  Where an instance at such a term
is needed (inside `timesSuccDeriv`, at terms over variables `0`, `1`),
we use `plusSuccDeriv'`, the α-variant of `plusSuccDeriv` at bound
variables `2`, `3` — derived from it by instantiate-and-regeneralize,
not re-proved.  `plusRightCommDeriv` binds `2`, `3`, `4` for the same
reason.
