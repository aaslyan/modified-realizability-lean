# Phase C: ordinal notations below `ε₀` and their order, at the value level

The value-level layer of the transfinite-induction rule `tiEps0`: the
notations, their order `≺`, the normal-form predicate that makes that
order well-founded, and the well-foundedness theorem itself.  It sits
*before* `Syntax.lean` in the module chain (like the Phase-B functions
`hlog`/`bumpN`/`goodN`) because `Term.eval` consumes the order as the
semantics of the new function symbol `prec`.

## Notations are natural numbers, and the coding is a bijection

The fragment's variables range over `ℕ` — it has no second sort — so the
rule `tiEps0` quantifies over *codes*.  A code is read as a
Cantor-normal-form tree:

    code 0                        ↦  the ordinal 0
    mkO e c r = ⟪e, ⟪c, r⟫⟫ + 1   ↦  ω^(e) · (c+1) + (r)

The pairing `⟪·,·⟫` is the triangular (Cantor) one, built from scratch
below.  It is a bijection, so `n ↦ (oE n, oC n, oR n)` inverts `mkO`
exactly (`mkO_oE_oC_oR`): **every** natural number is the code of exactly
one such tree, and every such tree has a code.  So the rule's
`∀x` ranges over precisely the notations — no unused codes, no partial
decoding.  The `+1`/`c+1` offsets are what make this exact: `0` is
reserved for the zero ordinal and coefficients are automatically
positive.

This is the same shape as Phase B's hereditary representations —
`hrep k n` is the term `x^e·c + r` in the base variable — with the base
variable read as `ω` instead of a numeral.  `TransfiniteInduction.lean`
makes that identification explicit (`ordTerm`, which decodes a code into
a Phase-B `HTerm`).

## The order, and why normal forms are not optional

`precB` is the standard Cantor-normal-form comparison: compare leading
exponents (recursively — ordinal comparison is always nested like
this), then coefficients, then remainders.  On **arbitrary** trees this
relation is *not* well-founded, and the counterexample is one line:

    ω  ≻  1 + ω  ≻  1 + (1 + ω)  ≻  1 + (1 + (1 + ω))  ≻  …

every step compares leading exponents `0 ≺ 1` and wins, while all four
trees denote the same ordinal `ω` (since `1 + ω = ω`).  Two
representations of one ordinal, and the comparison ranks one strictly
below the other: exactly the ambiguity Phase B could defer and this
phase cannot.  So the order used by the rule (`oltB`) conjoins the
comparison with the **normal-form predicate** `nfB` — remainders'
leading exponents strictly below the head exponent, hereditarily.  Non-
normal codes are then `≺`-isolated: nothing precedes them, so they are
trivially accessible, and the rule still concludes `∀x φ(x)` for every
natural number.

## Fuel, not well-founded recursion, at the value level

`precAux`/`nfAux` recurse structurally on fuel, with `oE`/`oR` strictly
decreasing (`oE_lt`, `oR_lt`) so that fuel `= a + b` (resp. `= n`) is
adequate.  Same reason as Phase B: `WellFounded.fix` does not reduce in
the kernel, and the concrete cross-checks of
`TransfiniteInduction.lean` are `rfl`/`decide`.  Since the pairing here
is also structural, the whole notation layer computes in the kernel.

The *realizer* combinator `tiRecC` (`Extraction.lean`) is the one place
genuine well-founded recursion is used — it is noncomputable and never
asked to reduce.  That is also why every proof in this file avoids
`Classical` (see `decEm`): `tiRecC`'s **definition** mentions `oLt_wf`,
so this file's axiom footprint is inherited by every continuity theorem
downstream.  It stays at `[propext, Quot.sound]`.
-/
import Mathlib.Logic.Function.Basic

namespace Realizability

/-- Decidable case split, spelled out.  Mathlib's `by_cases` tactic can
fall back on `Classical.byCases`, and everything in this module feeds the
*definition* of the recursor `tiRecC` — so a stray `Classical.choice`
here would show up in the axioms of every continuity theorem downstream.
Each case split below goes through this instead. -/
theorem decEm (p : Prop) [Decidable p] : p ∨ ¬ p :=
  if h : p then Or.inl h else Or.inr h

/-! ## A choice-free, kernel-computable pairing

Mathlib's `Nat.pair`/`Nat.unpair` cannot be used for the coding.  Its
inverse goes through `Nat.sqrt`, and *every* Mathlib lemma about that
pairing (`Nat.pair_unpair`, `Nat.unpair_left_le`, …) depends on
`Classical.choice`.  The coding enters the **definition** of the
recursor `tiRecC`, hence the axioms of every continuity theorem
downstream — where the budget is `[propext, Quot.sound]`.  `Nat.sqrt`
also fails to reduce in the kernel, which would cost the `rfl`
cross-checks.

So the triangular (Cantor) pairing is built here from scratch:
structural recursion, a fueled inverse (search downward for the largest
triangular number below `n`), and arithmetic-only proofs.  Both
directions reduce in the kernel, and nothing below depends on any axiom
beyond `propext`. -/

/-! ## Well-foundedness

The theorem the recursor rests on.  Structure of the proof — the
classical one for Cantor normal forms, with each induction named:

* `acc_zero`: the zero notation has no predecessors.
* `acc_mkO`: **three nested inductions**.  Outer, on the accessibility
  of the head exponent `e` (this is where the notation system's height
  is consumed); middle, strong induction on the coefficient; inner, on
  the accessibility of the remainder — itself obtained from the *outer*
  induction hypothesis, since a normal form's remainder has a head
  exponent strictly below `e`.  The three cases of `precB_cases` are
  discharged by exactly these three induction hypotheses, in order.
* `acc_of_nf`: strong induction on the code (both destructors strictly
  decrease it) supplies the head exponent's accessibility to `acc_mkO`.
* `oLt_wf`: normal codes by `acc_of_nf`, non-normal codes trivially —
  `oltB` requires normality of *both* sides, so nothing precedes a
  non-normal code.

No ordinals, no choice, no `Classical` case split: `nfB`/`precB` are
`Bool`-valued, so every case split above is decidable.  That keeps the
continuity theorems' axiom budget at `[propext, Quot.sound]` even
though `tiRecC` is defined by well-founded recursion on `OLt`. -/

/-! ## Totality of the comparison on normal forms

Phase C needed the order to be well-founded and irreflexive, never
*total*: its descent always related two notations that were built to be
related.  The Hydra layer needs totality — inserting an exponent into a
normal form has to know that if it is neither equal to nor above the head,
it is below it — so it is proved here.

The induction is the same three-way shape as the comparison itself:
compare head exponents, then coefficients, then remainders, with the
recursive calls at `(oE a, oE b)` and `(oR a, oR b)`, both of which shrink
the sum. -/
